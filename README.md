# Srikandi : The path of the chosen one

Between eternity and the human realm, Dewi Sri embodies two aspects of herself: the benevolence that nurtures life and the malevolence that breeds darkness. Her benevolent aspect flows in harmony within the human world, while her malevolence is trapped within Shoka Plains, a realm filled with sorrow and darkness. Every hundred years, Dewi Sri selects a demigod, Srikandi, from among humans to mend the weakening barrier between the two worlds, preventing the darkness from seeping into the earth.

In the current era, Shanti, a young girl known for her kindness, is chosen as Srikandi. One night, she awakens to find a mysterious figure urging her to embark on this sacred mission. Unaware of the full weight of her responsibility, Shanti must delve into the depths of Shoka Plains, confront evil entities, and restore balance between the two worlds. The greatest question is, how can Shanti, with limited guidance and newly discovered powers, overcome these challenges? Follow Shanti's journey through uncertainty, exploring a world full of mystery, and discovering the true strength within herself.
